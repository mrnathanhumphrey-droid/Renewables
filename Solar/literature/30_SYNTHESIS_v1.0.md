## 1. The arc in one paragraph

The substrate began with a meta-pre-reg locking LLM outputs out of the primary-evidence layer; verified 9 anchor papers (catching 5 attribution errors in the v0 LLM-written landscape); identified PVDAQ + NSRDB as the reachable public data; **executed Probe 2** (climate-PLR partition on 668 PVDAQ systems → replicates Jordan 2022's −0.79 %/yr magnitude but **REFUTED the climate-zone partition by underpower**); **executed Probe 2b** (quantified the mechanism — heterogeneity inflates σ_within 2× over Jordan's homogeneous cohort, costing ~6× more N); **executed Probe 3** (soiling on PVDAQ → FEASIBILITY-NULL: signal below the daily-energy noise floor); pivoted to DKA Alice Springs (arid + measured POA + multi-tech, operator-pulled 5.4 GB); **executed Probe 4** (DKA tech-controlled PLR → σ_within drops 8×, technology ordering visible — directly validates Probe 2b's lab-design prescription); **executed Probe 5** (DKA soiling → 3.87 %/yr, Ilse 2019 confirmed, PVDAQ-null vindicated); then **4 follow-up sub-probes** on the soiling result (5b rain alignment validated; 5c surprise inversion = wet > dry deposition; 5d synchrony separates natural vs operational cleaning; 5e null = soiling regime stable 12 years). End-state: a complete, internally consistent quantitative story about PV degradation + soiling at heterogeneous public fleets vs controlled arid single-site, with hard lab-design constraints quantified.

## 3. Methodological lessons established (the substrate's main payoff)

### L1. Daily-energy + modeled-irradiance PI has a measurement-noise floor that buries fine signals

PVDAQ residential daily AC-energy data, normalized by PVWatts-NSRDB modeled expected energy, carries ~32% measurement variance (Probe 2b §4b). This is fine for **multi-year YoY-median trends** (PLR) but **insufficient for within-year sawtooth signals** (soiling). Evidence: Probes 2/2b succeed on PLR; Probe 3 fails on soiling; Probe 5 succeeds on soiling using DKA's measured-POA-on-site PI.

→ **Lab/fleet design rule:** measured on-site POA + ≤daily cadence is required for fine-grained PV signal extraction.

### L2. Heterogeneity inflates within-cell variance and kills climate-effect detectability

PVDAQ's heterogeneous fleet (uncontrolled cell-tech, mixed mounting, mixed vintage) has σ_within = 1.99 %/yr — 2.0× Jordan 2022's homogeneous-cohort σ ~0.99 %/yr (Probe 2b §4b). Jordan's 0.40 %/yr climate-T effect at PVDAQ's σ corresponds to Cohen f=0.071 → power 0.49 at n=668. **Required N scales ~quadratically with σ inflation.** DKA's homogeneous σ=0.23 (8× tighter than PVDAQ) recovers detectability at small N — Probe 4 validates this with the technology ordering visible at n=6 fixed-mount.

→ **Rule:** for climate-driven effects, σ_within ≤ ~1 %/yr (homogeneous cohort) or 6× more N. Confirmed twice: predicted (2b), validated (4).

### L3. Pre-registration discipline catches non-feasibility before it becomes garbage

The substrate has now **3 cases** where the diagnostic-first / anti-over-interpretation discipline correctly stopped a probe that the data couldn't support:
- Probe 2b technology-controlled climate test: n=17 → pivoted to detectability analysis (rigorous mechanism quantification instead of underpowered η² estimate)
- Probe 3 PVDAQ soiling: 13–19% garbage + frequent failures → FEASIBILITY-NULL logged, no pre-reg locked
- Probe 4 per-phase tracker artifact: discovered mid-execution → flagged and carried forward as caveat, not over-interpreted

→ **Substrate convention:** feasibility-check before pre-reg-lock; report FEASIBILITY-NULL as a result type; never ship noise as signal.

### L4. Inter-system synchrony is a powerful tool for fleet-of-replicates soiling analytics (substrate-novel)

Probe 5d demonstrates that pairwise Jaccard + K-threshold consensus-day analysis on SRR recovery dates **separates natural environmental cleaning from operational/manual cleaning** in a multi-system single-site fleet. SRR alone conflates them in the `soiling_interval_summary`. This is methodologically novel as far as the substrate is aware (verification queued §6).

→ **Tool:** apply to any multi-system single-site soiling work where common-cause vs per-system cleaning is unresolved.

## 4. Substrate-novel findings flagged for external verification (next session)

Substrate-novel = the substrate generated the finding; literature anchor not yet checked. Per meta-pre-reg discipline, these are **VERIFIED-OWN** but need external triangulation before deeper inference.

| Finding | Memo | Verification target |
|---|---|---|
| **Wet-season DEPOSITION rate > dry-season at Alice Springs** (11/13, ratio 0.74×, p=0.998 opposite-direction) — "muddy soiling" mechanism | 29 §6c (CLM-093) | Atacama / Sahara / Mojave / Saudi soiling literature on rain-induced "cementation"; Ilse 2019 §discussion; Figgis Qatar papers |
| **Multi-system synchrony separates natural from operational cleaning** at K-threshold | 29 §6d (CLM-094, 095) | NREL soiling-monitoring methodology papers; rdtools documentation on multi-system cohorts; any DKA-specific operational logs |
| **2.0× σ_within inflation in heterogeneous fleet** (PVDAQ vs Jordan 2022) and **8× tightening in DKA homogeneous site** | 25 §4b (CLM-078); 28 §2 (CLM-083) | Jordan 2022 / Deceglie 2018 reported within-cohort SDs (back-solve check); any cross-fleet PV variance-decomposition paper |
| **CdTe-low soiling (3.15%, lowest single-system at DKA)** — n=1 directional | 29 §3 (CLM-090) | First Solar / CdTe glass-coating literature; anti-soiling thin-film papers |

## 5. Lab-design implications (consolidated for the future PV lab)

The substrate exists to inform a future PV research lab. Quantitative constraints established:

1. **For climate-driven degradation:** use **homogeneous cohorts** (single cell-tech, single mounting class) — heterogeneous public fleet aggregation fails (Probe 2). Target σ_within ≤ ~1 %/yr (DKA demonstrates 0.23 achievable).
2. **For soiling work:** **on-site measured POA + ≤daily cadence** is required (Probe 3 fails on daily-energy; Probe 5 succeeds on measured POA). Arid sites recommended for soiling — Alice Springs 3.87 %/yr is in the Ilse global aggregate range and is time-stable (Probe 5e).
3. **For cleaning ROI at arid sites:** **post-WET-season cleaning** may capture bulk of annual losses (Probe 5c surprise inversion: wet-season deposition is faster despite rain) — inverts the naive dry-season prescription. Verify per §4 before committing.
4. **For multi-system soiling analytics:** inter-system synchrony decomposition (Probe 5d) separates natural cleaning from operational interventions — apply before deriving annual rates.
5. **For PLR estimation:** PVWatts-DC normalization + rdtools YoY YoY + bootstrap CI is sufficient for fleet-aggregate magnitudes (Probe 2 replicated Jordan; Probe 4 reproduced expected ranges). Per-phase data for 3-phase systems is unreliable per-system (Probes 4/5 artifact); use phase-combined files.
6. **Sample-size targeting:** for a ~0.4 %/yr climate effect, need either σ_within ≤ ~1 %/yr or n ≥ ~2000 per zone. Pre-compute power before any partition design.
7. **Data acquisition order:** start with anchor verification → cohort identification → ℙ₀ assignment (no outcome inspection) → run → report. Never invert.

## 6. Open questions / candidate next probes

| Probe candidate | What it would close | Feasibility |
|---|---|---|
| Mount-effect clean test (DKA fixed vs tracker with phase-combined) | Mount confound in Probe 4 | Needs missing phase files (downloadable) |
| Orientation-effect (DKA 16A/B/C/D 4-orientation BP poly) | Tilt/azimuth confound | Needs operator-pull of 16A/B/C/D |
| CdTe-low-soiling replication | n=1 → n=≥3 | Needs catalog #23 Calyxo (operator-pull); + external CdTe datasets |
| External homogeneous-cohort climate test | Direct technology-controlled climate replication | DuraMAT blocked (network + confidentiality); needs alternate source (NREL RTC, manufacturer partnership) |
| Encapsulation × climate (T13-30 Sen et al. mechanism) | TOPCon UVID Probe 1 still blocked on cohort ID | Needs PVDAQ S3 per-system JSON metadata pull (≤1 day work if metadata exists) |
| LCOE / cleaning-interval ROI sketch | Applied-economics layer for lab vision | All inputs in hand (PLR, soiling, time-stability) |
